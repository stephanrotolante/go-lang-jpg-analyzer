## Go Lang JPG Decoder :art:

Ahoy!

Welcome to my Go Lang JPG decoder. It should be able to take a simple JPG file decode it, then display it in bitmap format. This decoder was implemented as a side project and may not be able to decode all jpg files

### How to use :video_game:

Run the go files and specify an input jpg file and an output for the bmp

```
go run *.go -file cat.jpg -output color.bmp
```

After execution you should be able to view the bitmap file. Take not the final size of the bmp file. It is significantly larger!
